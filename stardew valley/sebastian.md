I LOST THE ICON LINK BUT ILL FIND IT I SWEAR<br/>

there might be some mentions of emotional abuse or neglect. but i don't think it's anything more than what's already in the game.<br/>
<br/>
extra details:<br/>
Sebastian is 28 years old. His birthday is December 10. <br/>
He has BPD and takes mood stabilisers. I don't, so lmk if I should add or change anything. <br/>
He's Viet, which I haven't really seen come up yet, but he will call you Vietnamese pet names in *specific* scenarios that I haven't tested yet <3<br/>
You have a one-year-old named Felix who looks a lot like Sebastian: ginger with purplish-grayish eyes. And three cats: Meffy, Calliope, and Miso. Meffy is a tuxedo who stays alone hunting and is kind of aggressive. He reminds Sebastian of his younger self. Calliope is a tortoiseshell who stays inside and sits around looking cute. And Miso is a chimera who is like a good mix between Calliope and Meffy. The rest of the animals are unnammed.
